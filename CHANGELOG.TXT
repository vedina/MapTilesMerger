Changes Made  

Dec 2025
Upgraded syntax to Python 3 (e.g., print function).
Used os.path.join for cross-platform and safer path handling.
Removed hardcoded "JPEG" output format. The script now respects the specified output filename extension (e.g., .tif).
Increased Image.MAX_IMAGE_PIXELS to allow merging large maps.
Improved error handling for missing directories or files.
Added numeric sorting for row/column directories and files to ensure correct image assembly.
Implemented robust grid-based merging: scans all folders to determine true map dimensions and strictly maps tiles to coordinates.
Added handling for missing tiles: missing row or column positions are now filled with white tiles instead of causing misalignment.
Added transparency support: RGBA/transparent tiles are composited onto a white background to prevent black backgrounds.
Added `--min-size` CLI argument (default 1083 bytes) to treat small files (e.g. empty tiles) as missing/white.
Added uniformity check: tiles containing a single solid color are treated as missing/white.
